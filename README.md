# DeepRosa: Experimentation Environment for Clustering Algorithms

## Overview

Welcome to DeepRosa, an experimentation environment designed for testing and exploring clustering algorithms. DeepRosa provides a playground for researchers, data scientists, and enthusiasts to experiment with various clustering techniques, visualize data, and analyze algorithm performance.

## Features

- **Clustering Algorithms:** DeepRosa supports a variety of clustering algorithms, allowing users to compare and contrast their effectiveness on different datasets.
  
- **Interactive Data Visualization:** Visualize clustering results and relevant data through interactive plots and charts.

- **Experimentation Workspace:** A dedicated workspace for experimenting with algorithm parameters, input data, and observing real-time results.

- **Export and Share:** Save your experiments, results, and visualizations for further analysis or sharing with others.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the DeepRosa repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Liveir/DeepRosa.git

2. Navigate to the DeepRosa directory:

   ```bash
   cd DeepRosa
3. Initialize a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv/scripts/activate
   
4. Install dependencies. Make sure you are using the virtual environment created in the previous step:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Package the application into an executable:
   
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --add-data "venv/Lib/site-packages/customtkinter:customtkinter/" --add-data "Models:models" --add-data "Views:views" --add-data "Server:server" --noconsole --name DeepRosa --icon=Assets/dprosa_icon.ico dprosa.py 

5. The executable is located in the generated dist/ folder.

### Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python dprosa.py

2. Or, launch the executable
   ```bash
   dist/DeepRosa/DeepRosa.exe
